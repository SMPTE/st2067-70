## Details
Different user groups had manifested an interest in having a broadcast-ready format like VC-3 available to use with the IMF workflows. Having an application that natively uses VC-3 allows to achieve that avoiding need for any transcode operation. This document specifies an Application of the IMF framework specified in SMPTE ST 2067-2. The Application covers usage of the VC-3 codec as specified in SMPTE ST 2019-1.
