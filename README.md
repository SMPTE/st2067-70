ST 2067-70 IMF Application #7 ST 2019-1 VC-3 – Public Committee Draft (Public CD) Different user groups have manifested an interest in having a broadcast-ready format like VC-3 available to use with the IMF workflows. Having an application that natively uses VC-3 allows to achieve that avoiding need for any transcode operation. This document specifies an Application of the IMF framework specified in SMPTE ST 2067-2. The Application covers usage of the VC-3 codec as specified in SMPTE ST 2019-1. The goal of the public CD period is to encourage implementers to discover any issues with the application as well as to encourage interoperability between implementations. The initial public CD period is anticipated to be 6 months to allow time for preliminary implementations to appear and test.
